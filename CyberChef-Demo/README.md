# CyberChef - All in One Utility Tool
This project our team set to introduce a valuable tool in the security world that wasn't taught to us in class.  

<h3><b>Overview of Materials </b></h3> <br>
&#x2022; Powerpoint Slides <br>
&#x2022; name_count_puzzle.txt <br>
&#x2022; Video Demo.mp4  <br>
&#x2022; ReadMe Guide <br>

<h3><b> Main Challenge </b> </h3> <br>
&#x2022; The file name_count_puzzle.txt contains a large number of names. <br>
&#x2022; We must find out which name occurs the most. <br>
&#x2022; Utilizing Cyberchef we were able to accomplish this using only 4 recipes. <br>

<h3><b>CyberChef Advantage #1: Convenience </b> </h3> <br>
&#x2022; Accessible through web browser. <br>
&#x2022; Downloadable, enabling the ability to be run locally. <br>
&#x2022; Open Source and highly contributed to by the community. <br>

<h3><b>CyberChef Advantage #2: Versatility </b> </h3> <br>
&#x2022; Numerous commands involved as "recipes" to help manipulate and sift through data. <br>
&#x2022; Valuable in obsfucated analysis with the encryption and decryption tools. <br>
 

<h3><b>CyberChef Food for Thought</b> </h3> <br>
&#x2022; Working on sensitive data? <br>
<blockquote>Download CyberChef and run locally rather than through browser. </blockquote>
&#x2022; Vulnerable to SQL? <br>
<blockquote> It was in 2019 but has since been remedied.</blockquote>
    <blockquote> CVE-2019-15532</blockquote>
